It considers the relationship between <em>print</em> and <em>digital layout</em> processes and will explore methods of design thinking for digital publishing, through the use of technology and concepts.</p><p>You should use all of your knowledge of CSS, but you should focus on experimentation, iteration and translation. You must re-create 1 poster. The poster can come from any archive, but should be mostly typographic or shape based. You can not use any illustrations or any custom fonts. Just like translating a language you must make choices. Don't aim for accuracy of image, aim for accuracy of intent of the designer.</p></div></div>
